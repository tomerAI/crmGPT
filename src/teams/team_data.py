            ## Few-Shot Examples

            ### Example 1:
            **Conversation History**: The user provided specific requirements for sales data from Q1 2024.
            **Supervisor Decision**: Since the requirements seem clear, route to the **data_prompt_generator**.
            **Action**: Send conversation to the data_prompt_generator.

            ### Example 2:
            **Conversation History**: The data_gather_information agent asked for the time frame, but the user hasnâ€™t responded yet.
            **Supervisor Decision**: Since more input is needed from the user, route to **FINISH** to prompt the user for more information.
            **Action**: Send conversation to FINISH to prompt the user.

            ### Example 3:
            **Conversation History**: The user asked how data would be retrieved, which seems unrelated to the prompt creation process.
            **Supervisor Decision**: Route back to the user for clarification by using **FINISH**.
            **Action**: Send conversation to FINISH to clarify the user's questions.

            ### Example 4:
            **Conversation History**: The prompt has been generated, based on the user's input.
            **Supervisor Decision**: Route to the next team, which is the SQL generation team.
            **Action**: Send conversation to the sql_generation team.

            Now, based on the current conversation, route the conversation accordingly.
